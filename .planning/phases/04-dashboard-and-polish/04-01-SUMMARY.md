# Phase 4 Plan 01: Dashboard Page — Income/Expense Stat Cards Summary

**One-liner:** Dashboard page at /dashboard with independent date-filtered income/expense stat cards aggregating bank + CC data via MSW endpoint and Zustand store separate from filterStore.

## What Was Built

A complete DashboardPage with:
- Independent `dashboardStore` Zustand store (dateFrom/dateTo, setDateRange, resetDateRange) — completely separate from main `filterStore`
- `getDashboardStats` service with Zod validation calling GET /api/dashboard/stats
- `useDashboardStats` TanStack Query hook with `queryKey: ['dashboardStats', { dateFrom, dateTo }]`
- MSW handler at `/api/dashboard/stats` aggregating all mockTransactions + mockCreditCardTransactions, filtered by date range, returning totalIncome, totalExpense, bankIncome, bankExpense, ccExpense, categoryBreakdown, transactionCount
- `StatCard` component (income/expense variants) with TrendingUp/TrendingDown icons, green/red colors, formatVND, error state with retry button (min-h-[44px]), empty state with Vietnamese message
- `StatCardSkeleton` matching card dimensions for loading state
- `SourceSubtotals` showing bank/CC breakdown below main total
- `DashboardDatePicker` — responsive: native `<input type="date">` on mobile (sm:hidden), Calendar popover on desktop (hidden sm:flex), all interactive elements ≥48px
- `DashboardPage` with three-column grid (lg:grid-cols-3), chart slot placeholder (id=dashboard-chart-slot)
- `/dashboard` route added to App.tsx
- "Tổng quan" NavLink added before "Ngân hàng" in AppHeader with active highlighting

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Requirements Progress

- DASH-01: Income/expense totals visible for selected period — SATISFIED
- UX-01: Responsive layout and 48px tap targets — PARTIALLY SATISFIED (04-02 completes with chart and full mobile audit)
